// Homework 1
// Color to Greyscale Conversion

//A common way to represent color images is known as RGBA - the color
//is specified by how much Red, Grean and Blue is in it.
//The 'A' stands for Alpha and is used for transparency, it will be
//ignored in this homework.

//Each channel Red, Blue, Green and Alpha is represented by one byte.
//Since we are using one byte for each color there are 256 different
//possible values for each color.  This means we use 4 bytes per pixel.

//Greyscale images are represented by a single intensity value per pixel
//which is one byte in size.

//To convert an image from color to grayscale one simple method is to
//set the intensity to the average of the RGB channels.  This is the method
//we will use in this assignment.  A more sophisticated method takes into
//account how the eye perceives color and weights the channels unequally.

//You should fill in the kernel as well as set the block and grid sizes
//so that the entire image is processed.

  // .x -> R ; .y -> G ; .z -> B ; .w -> A

  //The output (greyImage) at each pixel should be the average 
  //of the RGB for that pixel. 
  //Note: We will be ignoring the alpha channel for this conversion

  //First create a mapping from the 2D block and grid locations
  //to an absolute 2D location in the image, then use that to
  //calculate a 1D offset
